# Ambien
Toggle dark mode in macOS Mojave based on ambient lighting

![Screenshot of Ambien]()

Ambien is a proof-of-concept app that uses the ambient light sensor on your Mac to switch between dark mode and light mode. When youâ€™re in a dark environment, your Mac will switch to dark mode. When youâ€™re in a brightly-lit environment, your Mac will switch to light mode.

### IMPORTANT
This app uses a private API to read data from the ambient light sensor. This means that Ambien may not work in a future version of macOS. Heck, it might even be broken right now. Iâ€™ve only tested this on my Mid 2014 MacBook Pro, so who knows if itâ€™ll work for you Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

Also, this was hacked together in several hours and originally intended for my own personal use. So please donâ€™t judge my code ðŸ˜”
